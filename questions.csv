"What distinguishes a state chart from an FSM, and provide an example of its application?","State charts, part of UML, are more powerful with initial/base states, rectangular states, and eventless returns. Example: A vending machine accepting coins for a 30-cent drink, tracking state transitions."
"Explain the components of a Petri-net and how it models dynamic systems.","Petri-nets include places (circles, resources), transitions (bars, actions), edges (resource requirements), and tokens (available resources). They model dynamic systems by firing transitions, dynamically updating tokens to simulate resource flow."
"How can a Petri-net be used to address the 3-bankers paradox in software systems?","A Petri-net models the 3-bankers paradox by using places for chopsticks, transitions for eating, and tokens for resource availability, preventing deadlocks through careful token management."
"Describe the rules for developing a Petri-net for a college library system based on the notes.","Register new books before shelving. Require valid IDs for checkouts. Return books before deadlines for reshelving. Fine late returns (<6 months). Report/suspend for books not returned (>6 months). Sell books checked out >100 times. Ensure interconnected nets, avoid direct place-to-place or transition-to-transition connections, and use AND gates for transitions."
"What is the 3-bankers paradox, and how does it relate to deadlock in computer science?","The 3-bankers paradox involves three bankers needing two chopsticks to eat, risking deadlock if each holds one. In CS, it illustrates resource allocation issues, solved by priority queues or time-sharing to avoid deadlocks."
"How does the explore-and-exploit strategy in reinforcement learning apply to software development?","Explore (e.g., prototyping to test ideas) and exploit (e.g., refining based on feedback) optimize development by balancing innovation with proven methods, like evaluating candidates after exploring 37% of the pool."
